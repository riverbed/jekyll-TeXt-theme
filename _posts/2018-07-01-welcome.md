Hi there everyone!  My name is Brandon Carroll, and I'm one of the Technical Evangelist' here at [Riverbed](https://www.riverbed.com).

Part of my job is sharing really cool technical features of our products and solutions with _you_!  That's right, __you__.  Living the dream right?  I know!  But I can't do it alone.  I have a team of highly technical people that I work with that do the exact same thing in their respective areas of expertise.  

## Romain Jourdan

Our team is lead by Romain Jourdan.  Romain is a Passionate Technologist with 16 years of experience. He is far from being perfect (he is French), but still, his technical prowess makes up for all of that! He is profoundly geeky and secretly in love with Alexa. Romain is skilled in the entire Riverbed portfolio.  He kinda has to be since he runs the group. Romain's favorite quote is: “Failing to plan is planning to fail.”

Romain is based at Riverbed headquarters in San Francisco, Ca.

## Joe Mccarthy

Joe is a Senior Technical Evangelist here at Riverbed. He hates to admit this, but he started in technology prior to the invention of the World Wide Web! From Joe’s early days working as a Network Manager at DEC, (Digital Equipment Corporation for those too young to remember) through the Start-Up generation working at many Dot Coms as an SE, and surviving Y2K to our current day, his passion has always been understanding customers challenges then finding a “solution”. To free his brain you can find Joe blasting down black diamonds or dropping into chutes while backcountry skiing. When the snow melts it’s cycling or adventure riding on his KTM to faraway places. Another thing Joe realized after joining the Tech Evangelist group is “anything that goes wrong, it’s Joe’s fault” and he’s good with that! 

Joe is based in New Hampshire

Yep!  That's me.  I try my best to be a highly technical content contributor and I;ve been around the networking industry as a Tech Republic contributor, a several-time Tech Field Day delegate, as well as a guest of the Packet Pushers podcast and Network Collective podcast.  I've been privileged enough to become a published author with a few books under the Cisco Press label, mostly in the area of security. I would say that I'm kinda an an uber-geek, although I love to ride dirt bikes (WR-250F) and BMX bikes (My 2013 Big Ripper is pretty sweet!) with my kids.  I'm pretty proficient with SteelConnect, Steelhead SD, WANOP, Firewalls, and a bunch of Cisco stuff that may not matter anymore.  I've spent the better part of my carrer as a Cisco Certified Instructor (CCSI), so hopefully that experience comes out in the articles and videos I share with you.  

Oh yeah, I also hold the CCIE Security (23837) certification.


I am based in Temecula, California

But as it should be, you should know who we are if you're going to read and trust the technical material we are presenting.  We hope you enjoy our contributions to the technical community and look forward to seeing you at the various industry shows.

Happy Labbing!
