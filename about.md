## Joe Mccarthy

Joe is a Senior Technical Evangelist here at Riverbed. He hates to admit this, but he started in technology prior to the invention of the World Wide Web! From Joe’s early days working as a Network Manager at DEC, (Digital Equipment Corporation for those too young to remember) through the Start-Up generation working at many Dot Coms as an SE, and surviving Y2K to our current day, his passion has always been understanding customers challenges then finding a “solution”. To free his brain you can find Joe blasting down black diamonds or dropping into chutes while backcountry skiing. When the snow melts it’s cycling or adventure riding on his KTM to faraway places. Another thing Joe realized after joining the Tech Evangelist group is “anything that goes wrong, it’s Joe’s fault” and he’s good with that! 

Joe is based in New Hampshire
